      Question 4
      You are provided with the Data class that contains an items array (Data.items) which is an array of items in a store. Each element in the array represents a single item record. Each record in the array represents a single item record. Each record is a string formatted as : Name, ID, Price. Also, you are provided with an array called shoppingCart (Data.shoppingCart) which is an array of items’ quantities. Each element in the array represents a single item record. Each record is a string formatted as : ID, quantity. You are asked to perform the following tasks:

     1. Your implementation for this question should be included in MainPart3.java file.
     2. Create a StoreItem class that should parse all the parameters for each item. Hint: extract each value from a item's record using Java's String.split() method and set the
        delimiter to a comma, see provided code below. Each item record should to be assigned to a StoreItem object.
     3. Create the most efficient data structure that best fit the goal. Hint: The selected data structure should facilitate the retrieval of the item details based on the ID.
     4. The goal is to print out the receipt bill in the following format:
        ID  Name    Quantity    Price * Quantity
